### About Rittman Mead
Rittman Mead was founded in 2007 with the goal of becoming the world's leading Oracle Data Warehousing and Business Intelligence company. For the first few years, we achieved this through the projects we delivered, our blog and community contribution.

The market began to change quickly. The rise of open source, big data technologies gave us more possibilities for processing and storing data; the cloud gave organisations a different commercial model; predictive analytics and data science started to unlock the potential of the organisation's data; advanced data visualisation techniques enabled it to be communicated to a broader audience. More mainstream DevOps practices were adopted into traditional ETL and business intelligence projects to support agile delivery methods.

Today, our partner and product portfolios reflect these changes. Oracle remains a partner; however, we are now joined by Cloudera, Tableau, MapR, Confluent and AWS. We have built out a dedicated R&D department focused on researching the adoption and incorporation of new and emerging technologies, plus building development frameworks and DevOps hooks into them.

The result is that while we still strive to be a global leader in data and analytics, now we cover a broader set of technologies. Couple that with our 15 years' experience of successfully delivering solutions in this industry, and we feel we are uniquely placed to provide hybrid solutions across a full breadth of enterprise and open source technologies.
